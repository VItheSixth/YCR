# You Can[Not] Re:Turn (YCR)
This repository contains Cockatrice files necessary to play with a custom MtG set I've been making for fun.

# Pitch
The year is 2012. In December 21, the world as we knew it ended as prophesied by the Mayan calendar. But there was no meteorite or sudden collapse of all civilization. Instead **THEY** came.

At midnight UTC+9, **imaginary characters, creatures, objects** and places from novels, comic books, manga and fairy tales escaped the confines of their respective stories and were set free into the world of their audience. Of their creators. Our world. This pivotal event would later be referred to as the "Crossover", and would mark a point of no return for the planet.

The exact numbers remain unknown, but it was no isolated case: the sudden appearance of entire populations was reported across all five continents. Cities were leveled and landscapes were scarred as clashes between super-powered beings, death robots and giant monsters became commonplace. Japan was the epicenter of the phenomenon. In the span of a month, South Asia as a whole was on the brink of ruin, its nations having to band together to avoid falling into total chaos.

Dubbed **"Fictionals"** by the international community, Earth's new inhabitants brought with them countless crises, mysteries, opportunities and ethical conundrums. But one thing was for certain: **they have full agency now.** What will they do with it? Only time will tell.

# Mechanics
- **Popularity X** (All colors): Fictionals can draw power from the support of their fans amongst humans to achieve great feats. When you cast a spell with Popularity X, you may tap X untapped Citizen you control to make it more powerful. The set has multiple ways to let you trigger these abilities in all colors, be it with Citizen creatures or other permanents that can be tapped in their stead.
- **Underdog** (White/Red): Everyone loves a good underdog story. When faced with stronger foes, Fictionals can call upon their resolve to unleash their true potential. When a creature with Underdog attacks, if the defending player controls a creature with higher power, it triggers an effect.
- **Nekketsu** (Black/Red): Fictionals are able to push past their limits to turn the tide of battle, even if it means risking their lives. When a creature with Nekketsu would be dealt damage, it gains indestructible until end of turn and triggers an effect. This power surge has a dire cost, for you must then sacrifice the creature at the next end step.
- **Segregate X** (Blue/Black/Green): Humans and Fictionals often don't get along, with fear and prejudice motivating each side to take drastic measures to preserve themselves. When you have a creature segregate X, mill X cards and put a +1/+1 counter on it for each nonland permanent milled this way.
- **Investigate** (Blue/Green): Information is power, be it when searching for an opponent's weakness in its source material, finding someone's true identity or reversing the Awakening to go back home... if it's even possible. When you investigate, create a Clue token that you can sacrifice to draw a card.
